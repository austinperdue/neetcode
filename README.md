# NeetCode DSA Practice

Welcome to my **NeetCode** repository! This is a personal repository dedicated to practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using concepts and problems inspired by [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io). It serves as a resource for improving my problem-solving skills and preparing for technical interviews.

## Introduction

This repository contains:
- Solutions to various DSA problems.
- Explanations, code comments, and an analysis of each solution.
- A record of my progress over time.

By organizing my work here, I aim to:
- Strengthen my foundation in data structures and algorithms.
- Keep track of my learning journey.

## Technologies & Languages

I primarily use **Python** for solving problems, but you may also find solutions in other languages such as **Java** or **C**, depending on the problem or my approach.

- **Python**
- **Java** or **C** (where applicable)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders by course on **[NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io)**. For example:

Each folder contains:
- **Python:** Implemented solutions of Python problems.
- **Object Oriented Design:** Implemented solutions of object-oriented programming problems by focusing on design patterns and principles.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Implemented solutions of DSA problems. Used for a refresher and reference. Time and space complexities are documented.


## How I Use This Repository

1. **Problem Practice:** I select problems from NeetCode.io and practice them here.
2. **Learning Journal:** After solving a problem, I often add notes or reflections on what I learned, potential optimizations, and alternative solutions.
3. **Review & Refactor:** I revisit older problems to improve or refactor solutions as my understanding deepens.
4. **Preparation:** Before interviews, I review problems and patterns to reinforce my knowledge.
